In the startup investing context, a convertible note is most useful ahead of equity rounds when there's a need for flexible terms without a valuation. The note, at its core, is a debt instrument that allows a company to take in capital for equity at the next round according to certain parameters. Principally, but not essentially, the parameters include a valuation cap, an interest rate, maturation date, and governing terms for the converted equity.
